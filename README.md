## Description
The task at hand is to develop an API for a social networking web platform, offering users the ability to post their thoughts, interact with the thoughts of their friends, and manage a list of friends. The project leverages Express.js for managing routes, a MongoDB database for data storage, and the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for efficient database interaction. While crafting this solution, you have the flexibility to incorporate either the built-in JavaScript Date object or opt for a third-party JavaScript date library to handle timestamp formatting. This comprehensive technology stack empowers you to create a feature-rich and seamless social network API.
